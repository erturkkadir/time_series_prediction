Time Series Prediction with LSTM

DATA 

FOREX DATA with followings

Folder name is sampling rate

 M1 : 1 min data with currency pair
 M5 : 5 min data with currency pair
 
 
 The target of the project is to project future value of currency pair by using previous data. 
 This methods are called technical trading which assumes the future value is defined by the previous values
 
 All the process will be on the Frequency Domain,
 
 We assume that the frequency component of each time frame has long/short time effect of future values
 Is there a way to learn this pattern to predict future values with acceptable certainty
 
 
 We will do all the work on historic data.
 
 
 Simulation is the main program and please refer to explanation of each parameters
 
 We will use phase and sum of imag and real part of signal which is against to definition. 
 
 However if we use power we would be lose the sign of each part.
